# Student_Performance_Prediction

The aim of this work is to apply the knowledge acquired during the Data Spaces course on a specific dataset. The  analysis  and  the  experiments  are  performed  on  UCI  Machine  Learning Student Performance Data Set, that can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance. The dataset contains student achievements in Secondary education collectedduring the 2005-2006 school years from two public schools, from the Alentejoregion of Portugal.
